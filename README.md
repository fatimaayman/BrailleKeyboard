# BrailleKeyboard
A cheap braille keyboard that can be used anywhere by only one hand. Since the braille alphabet is just a combination of dots in a 3x2 matrix, it can be implemented using two fingers. each phalanges of the two fingers will represent a dot in the matrix. 

## Current Status
Currently a DialPad with similar concept is implemented as a prototype to test the idea of having a textile keyboard. Digital input pins represent the numbers from 1-9. Each pin will be connected to a conductive sewing snap on a glove via a conductive copper thread on the last three fingers of the right hand. Another snap on the tip of the thumb will be connected to the ground and will be used to select the input pin.
At the moment, the code is ready for the dial pad but the textile hardware connection is yet to be connected and tested.
